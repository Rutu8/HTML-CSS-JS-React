                <h1>This is article about Flowers</h1><br>
                <p>A flower, also known as a bloom or 
                    blossom,[1] is the reproductive structure 
                    found in flowering plants (plants of the
                     division Angiospermae). Flowers consist
                      of a combination of vegetative organs – 
                      sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower.
                       Petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce
                        gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the
                         anthers. 
                        The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.[2][3] In some plants, 
                        multiple flowers occur singly on a pedicel (flower stalk), 
                        and some are arranged in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle
                     (inflorescence stalk).</p>
                     <p>Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, 
                        to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies,
                         including brightly colored, large petals with patterns only visible to under ultraviolet light, attractive scents,
                          and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[4][2] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with 
                          pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another—in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; 
                          in the pollinator's case,
                         a source of food.[5]</p>

                         <p>When pollen from the anther of a flower is transferred to the stigma to another, 
                            it is called pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant,
                             but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the 
                             anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens
                              in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma.
                               This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[6] Some flowers produce 
                               diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).[7] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit 
                            containing seeds.[2]</p>

                            <p>The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure,[10] can be considered in two parts: 
                                the vegetative part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. 
                                A stereotypical flower is made up of four kinds of structures arranged in whorls around the tip of a short stalk or axis, 
                                called a receptacle.[11][2] The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx, corolla,
                                 androecium, and gynoecium. Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the perianth, and in monocotyledons, 
                                 may not be differentiated. 
                                If this is the case, then they are described as tepals.[2][12]</p>

                                <p>Although this arrangement is considered "typical", plant species show a wide variation
                                     in floral structure.[20] The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their
                                      positions on the receptacle and not by their function.
                                       Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions or look like what is typically another part.
                                       In some families, such as the grasses, the petals are greatly reduced; in many species, the sepals are colorful and petal-like. 
                                       Other flowers have modified petal-like stamens;
                                     the double flowers of peonies and roses are mostly petaloid stamens.[22]</p>
                                     <p>A floral formula is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific letters, 
                                        numbers, and symbols, presenting substantial information about the flower in a compact form.
                                         It can represent a taxon, usually giving ranges of the numbers of different organs, or particular species.
                                          Floral formulae have been developed in the early 19th century and their use has declined since.
                                           Prenner et al. (2010) devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula.[32] 
                                           The format of floral formulae differs in different parts of the world, 
                                        yet they convey the same information.</p>
                                        <p>A flower develops on a modified shoot or axis from a determinate apical meristem (determinate meaning the axis grows to a set size). 
                                            It has compressed internodes, bearing structures that in classical plant morphology are interpreted as highly modified leaves.
                                             Detailed developmental studies, however, have shown that stamens are often initiated more or less like modified stems (caulomes)
