                <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h1><br>
                <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations.
                    Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means,
                    with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively
                    short
                    stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>

                <p>Travel agencies help clients plan travel by selling travel products and services on behalf of
                    suppliers.
                    They can arrange transportation, lodging, car rentals, and tours. They can also provide travel
                    information,
                    such as public transportation timetables, and arrange for luggage and medical item delivery. </p>

                <p>Travel agencies act as agents for travel suppliers, such as airlines, hotels, and cruise lines.
                    They may also act as general sales agents for airlines that don't have offices in a specific region.
                </p>
                <p>Travel agents are the people who work in travel agencies and are also known as travel advisors. They
                    should be courteous, helpful, and able to work under pressure. They should also have a good
                    knowledge of geography, customs,
                    and practices in different countries. </p>
                <p>Online travel agencies (OTAs) are a type of travel agency that allow
                    customers to search and book travel products online.</p>

                <h5 style="text-align: center;">We follow all Safety Rules</h5>
                <p>Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety.[16] When
                    traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however, travelers can be subject to
                    difficulties, crime and violence.[17] Some safety considerations include being aware of one's
                    surroundings,[16] avoiding being the target of a crime,[16] leaving copies of one's passport and
                    itinerary information with trusted people,[16] obtaining medical insurance valid in the country
                    being visited[16] and registering with one's national embassy when arriving in a foreign
                    country.[16] Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries; however most
                    countries accept international driving permits.[18] Automobile insurance policies issued in one's
                    own country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often a requirement to obtain
                    temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited.[18] It is also advisable to become
                    oriented with the driving rules and regulations of destination countries.[18] Wearing a seat belt is
                    highly advisable for safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.[18]
